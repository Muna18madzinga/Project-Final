# Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the application to protect against various threats.

## Network Security

### Network Monitoring
- Real-time packet analysis for malicious patterns
- Detection of common attacks (SYN floods, port scans, DDoS)
- Automatic IP blocking for suspicious activities

### Firewall Integration
- Dynamic rule management
- Temporary and permanent IP blocking
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Authentication Security

### Password Security
- Minimum password length enforcement
- Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
- Password history to prevent reuse
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Detection of compromised passwords (Have I Been Pwned integration)
- Prevention of password reuse across platforms (Google Drive, social media)

### Session Management
- Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Session timeout and regeneration
- Protection against session fixation

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- Configurable request limits
- IP-based throttling
- Customizable time windows

### Input Validation
- Protection against injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- Request payload analysis
- Malicious pattern detection

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Security Manager**
   - Centralized security management
   - Threat detection and response
   - Logging and alerting

2. **Packet Analyzer**
   - Deep packet inspection
   - Pattern matching for known attacks
   - Anomaly detection

3. **Firewall Controller**
   - System-level firewall integration
   - Dynamic rule management
   - Cross-platform compatibility

### Configuration

Security settings can be configured in `config/security_config.py`:

```python
# Example configuration
SECURITY_CONFIG = {
    'monitoring_enabled': True,
    'block_malicious': True,
    'alert_threshold': 0.7,
    # ... other settings
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **For Developers**
   - Always validate and sanitize user input
   - Use prepared statements for database queries
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

2. **For Administrators**
   - Regularly review security logs
   - Keep the system and dependencies patched
   - Monitor for unusual activities
   - Regularly rotate API keys and credentials

## Incident Response

1. **Detected Threats**
   - Log all security events
   - Automatic blocking of malicious IPs
   - Alert administrators for critical events

2. **Reporting**
   - Security logs are stored in `security.log`
   - Detailed error messages for debugging
   - Audit trail for all security-related actions
