# Process Analysis Workflow - How Your System Works

## Overview
Your adaptive security system processes threats in real-time through a complete pipeline: from collecting network data, cleaning and preparing it, analyzing it with machine learning models, making security decisions, and finally enforcing protection measures.

---

## The Complete Workflow (Step by Step)

### **1. START: System Initialization**
**What happens:** When your system boots up, it activates the core security environment.

**Files involved:**
- `app/__init__.py` - Initializes the Flask application
- `config/security_config.py` - Loads security configurations
- `app/architecture/telemetry_collection.py` - Prepares data collection agents

**What you'll see:**
- Network monitoring agents start listening on network interfaces
- Endpoint monitoring begins tracking system metrics
- All security models load into memory
- Connection to the telemetry stream is established

---

### **2. TELEMETRY INGESTION: Collecting Security Data**
**What happens:** Your system continuously gathers security data from multiple sources simultaneously (like having multiple security cameras watching different areas).

**Components working:**

#### **Network Telemetry Agent** ([telemetry_collection.py:33](app/architecture/telemetry_collection.py#L33))
- Captures network packets using Scapy
- Tracks IP addresses, ports, protocols, packet sizes
- Monitors traffic flows between systems
- Detects suspicious patterns (oversized packets, unusual ports)

#### **Endpoint Telemetry Agent** ([telemetry_collection.py:179](app/architecture/telemetry_collection.py#L179))
- Monitors CPU usage, memory consumption, disk activity
- Tracks running processes and new process creation
- Records failed login attempts and file access events
- Watches for privilege escalation attempts

#### **Stream Processor** ([telemetry_collection.py:316](app/architecture/telemetry_collection.py#L316))
- Combines data from all agents into a unified stream
- Buffers up to 100,000 events for processing
- Operates continuously in background threads
- Delivers batches of telemetry for analysis

**Real example:** If someone tries to brute-force your login, the endpoint agent captures the failed attempts while the network agent sees the repeated connection attempts - both feed into the stream.

---

### **3. PREPROCESSING: Cleaning and Preparing Data**
**What happens:** Raw security data is messy - duplicates, missing values, outliers. Your preprocessing pipeline cleans and enriches this data so machine learning models can analyze it effectively.

**The Pipeline** ([data_preprocessing.py:576](app/data_preprocessing.py#L576)):

#### **Step 3.1: DataCleaner** ([data_preprocessing.py:42](app/data_preprocessing.py#L42))
**Job:** Remove noise and fix data quality issues

- **Removes duplicates** - Identical events are dropped (like seeing the same alert twice)
- **Handles missing data** - Uses smart methods:
  - If <10% missing: fills with median/mode
  - If 10-50% missing: uses KNN imputation (looks at similar events to fill gaps)
  - If >50% missing: warns about data quality
- **Removes outliers** - Uses IQR (Interquartile Range) method to detect statistical anomalies
  - Calculates normal ranges for metrics
  - Only removes extreme outliers (3× IQR)
  - Keeps suspicious-but-plausible events

**Example:** Network packet sizes typically range 64-1500 bytes. If you see 50,000-byte packets, that's removed as noise. But 9,000 bytes (jumbo frames) might be flagged but kept.

#### **Step 3.2: FeatureEngineer** ([data_preprocessing.py:244](app/data_preprocessing.py#L244))
**Job:** Create meaningful features from raw data

**Entropy Features** - Measures randomness in data:
- Shannon entropy for payloads (random data suggests encryption or obfuscation)
- Byte frequency entropy (malware often has different byte patterns)

**Time-Series Features** - Understanding patterns over time:
- Rolling averages (is this traffic spike unusual compared to last 5 minutes?)
- Exponentially weighted moving averages (recent events matter more)
- Z-scores (how many standard deviations from normal?)

**Network-Specific Features**:
- Port classification (well-known ports <1024, dynamic ports >49152)
- Packet size distributions (log-transformed for better model performance)
- Protocol one-hot encoding (converts "TCP", "UDP" to numerical format)

**Interaction Features** - Combinations that matter:
- Packet size × request frequency (small packets at high frequency = potential DDoS)
- Failed attempts / time_elapsed (rapid failures = brute force)

**Example:** A login attempt becomes: `[failed_attempts=10, time_since_last=1sec, new_device=True, distance_from_usual=5000km, unusual_hour=3AM, ...]`

#### **Step 3.3: DataNormalizer** ([data_preprocessing.py:438](app/data_preprocessing.py#L438))
**Job:** Scale features to consistent ranges

- Uses StandardScaler (mean=0, std=1) for normal distributions
- Uses RobustScaler for data with outliers (based on median/IQR)
- Critical for neural networks (ensures stable training)

**Example:** Packet counts (0-10,000) and ports (0-65,535) get scaled to similar ranges like (-2 to +2)

#### **Step 3.4: DataBalancer** ([data_preprocessing.py:491](app/data_preprocessing.py#L491))
**Job:** Fix imbalanced datasets

**Why needed:** In network traffic, 87% is normal, 13% are attacks. Models trained on this learn to just say "normal" for everything.

**Solution - ADASYN** (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling):
- Generates synthetic attack samples that are harder to classify
- Focuses on borderline cases (near the decision boundary)
- Creates balanced training sets (50/50 normal vs attack)

**Example:** If you have 1,000 normal samples and 100 attack samples, ADASYN creates 900 synthetic attack samples so the model sees equal amounts.

#### **Step 3.5: PrivacyPreserver** ([data_preprocessing.py:529](app/data_preprocessing.py#L529))
**Job:** Protect sensitive data with differential privacy

- Adds calibrated Laplace noise before storing telemetry
- Uses Opacus library for PyTorch training with privacy guarantees
- Configurable epsilon (ε=1.0) controls privacy vs accuracy tradeoff

**Example:** IP address 192.168.1.100 might be stored as 192.168.1.103 (slightly perturbed) so individual users can't be tracked while attack patterns remain detectable.

**Output:** Clean, normalized, balanced dataset ready for ML models with shapes like:
- Training: (8,000 samples, 150 features)
- Validation: (1,000 samples, 150 features)
- Testing: (2,000 samples, 150 features)

---

### **4. ANALYSIS: Execute ML Detection Models**
**What happens:** Preprocessed data flows through PyTorch deep learning models that detect threats in real-time.

**Models in Your System:**

#### **Hybrid LSTM-Transformer Detector** ([analytics_layer.py:42](app/architecture/analytics_layer.py#L42))
**Best for:** Sequential attack patterns (multi-stage attacks)

- **LSTM layers** - Remember patterns over time (login attempts spread over hours)
- **Transformer attention** - Focus on important events (sudden privilege escalation)
- **Adversarial defense** - Dropout + LayerNorm resist evasion attempts
- **Output:** Anomaly probability (0.0 = normal, 1.0 = threat)

**Example:** Detects an attacker who logs in normally, then 30 minutes later starts scanning the network, then attempts lateral movement.

#### **CNN Threat Detector** ([pytorch_detector.py:30](app/pytorch_detector.py#L30))
**Best for:** Spatial patterns in payloads (SQL injection, XSS)

- **1D Convolution** - Scans payload strings for attack signatures
- **Pattern recognition** - Learns that `'OR'1'='1` appears in SQLi attacks
- **Multi-class output** - Classifies into 10 threat types

**Example:** Detects `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in HTTP requests even if it's obfuscated.

#### **Autoencoder Anomaly Detector** ([pytorch_detector.py:93](app/pytorch_detector.py#L93))
**Best for:** Zero-day threats (never-seen-before attacks)

- **Encoder** - Compresses normal behavior to 32-dimensional representation
- **Decoder** - Reconstructs input from compressed form
- **Reconstruction error** - High error = anomaly (doesn't match normal patterns)

**Example:** Trained only on normal traffic, it flags new malware C&C traffic because it "doesn't look like anything I've seen before."

#### **Deep MLP Classifier** ([pytorch_detector.py:128](app/pytorch_detector.py#L128))
**Best for:** General threat classification

- **Residual blocks** - Deep network (512→256→128 neurons) with skip connections
- **Multi-class classification** - Categorizes threats into specific types
- **Fast inference** - Optimized for real-time detection

**Inference Flow:**

```
Input Event → Preprocess → All Models Run in Parallel → Ensemble Voting
                              ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓
                            CNN(0.9)  LSTM(0.8)  AE(0.7)  MLP(0.85)
                                          ↓
                              Majority Vote: THREAT (3/4 agree)
                              Avg Confidence: 0.81
                              Threat Type: sql_injection
```

**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** ([analytics_layer.py:151](app/architecture/analytics_layer.py#L151)):
Every detected threat maps to MITRE tactics:
- SQL Injection → Initial Access (T1190), Execution (T1059)
- Brute Force → Credential Access (T1110)
- DDoS → Impact (T1498)

**Performance:** Average inference time ~15ms per event, can process 60+ events/second on CPU.

---

### **5. POLICY DECISION: Risk Assessment and Action Planning**
**What happens:** The system evaluates threat analysis results and decides what action to take using Zero Trust principles.

**Components:**

#### **User Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** ([policy_engine.py:71](app/architecture/policy_engine.py#L71))
**Tracks:** Individual behavior patterns for users, devices, applications

**Maintains profiles:**
- Baseline behavior (what's normal for this user?)
- Recent activities (last 1,000 events)
- Risk score (0.0-1.0, updated continuously)
- Trust level (starts at 1.0, decreases with anomalies)
- Anomaly history (last 100 security incidents)

**Example:**
```
User: john@company.com
- Baseline: Logs in 9AM-5PM EST, accesses 5-10 files/day
- Current: Login at 3AM from China, accessing 500 files
- Risk Score: 0.92 (CRITICAL)
- Trust Level: 0.12 (VERY LOW)
→ Action: DENY + QUARANTINE
```

#### **Policy Engine** - Makes decisions based on:

1. **Threat Confidence** (from ML models)
2. **Entity Risk Score** (from UEBA)
3. **MITRE Tactics** (attack severity)
4. **Compliance Requirements** (regulatory needs)

**Decision Matrix:**

| Risk Level | Threat Confidence | Action | Duration |
|-----------|------------------|---------|----------|
| LOW | <0.3 | MONITOR | Continuous |
| MEDIUM | 0.3-0.6 | RESTRICT | 30 min |
| HIGH | 0.6-0.8 | QUARANTINE | 2 hours |
| CRITICAL | >0.8 | DENY | 24 hours |

**Output - PolicyDecision:**
```json
{
  "decision_id": "PD-2025-001234",
  "entity_id": "192.168.1.100",
  "action": "QUARANTINE",
  "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "reasoning": [
    "SQL injection pattern detected (confidence: 0.92)",
    "Source IP not in whitelist",
    "Failed authentication attempts: 15",
    "MITRE Tactic: Initial Access (T1190)"
  ],
  "recommended_duration": 120,  // minutes
  "additional_controls": [
    "Enable enhanced monitoring",
    "Require MFA for next login",
    "Notify security team"
  ]
}
```

---

### **6. ENFORCEMENT: Apply Security Controls**
**What happens:** Policy decisions translate into actual security measures using software-defined networking.

**Virtual SDN Controller** ([enforcement_layer.py:70](app/architecture/enforcement_layer.py#L70))

#### **Network Segmentation:**

**Quarantine Networks** - Isolated VLANs:
- `192.168.100.0/24` - Full quarantine (no network access)
- `192.168.101.0/24` - Restricted (limited internet, no internal resources)
- `192.168.102.0/24` - Enhanced monitoring (full access, all traffic logged)

**Enforcement Actions:**

1. **BLOCK_IP** - Drop all traffic from source
   ```
   Rule: DENY src=192.168.1.100 dst=* protocol=* port=*
   Priority: 1000 (highest)
   Expires: 2 hours
   ```

2. **QUARANTINE_ENDPOINT** - Move to isolated VLAN
   ```
   Move device MAC:00:11:22:33:44:55 → VLAN 100
   Apply micro-segmentation rules
   Allow only DNS + DHCP
   ```

3. **RESTRICT_NETWORK** - Limit access
   ```
   ALLOW src=192.168.1.100 dst=8.8.8.8 protocol=DNS
   DENY src=192.168.1.100 dst=192.168.0.0/16 (internal)
   MONITOR all outbound connections
   ```

4. **ISOLATE_SESSION** - Terminate active connections
   ```
   TCP RST → Active sessions from 192.168.1.100
   Block new connections
   Require re-authentication
   ```

**TLS 1.3 Security** - All enforcement commands use encrypted channels:
- SDN controller ↔ Virtual switches (TLS 1.3)
- Self-signed certificates for lab environment
- Perfect forward secrecy (PFS)

**Result Tracking:**
```json
{
  "action_id": "ENF-2025-001234",
  "enforcement_actions": ["BLOCK_IP", "QUARANTINE_ENDPOINT"],
  "success": true,
  "affected_entities": ["192.168.1.100", "user:john@company.com"],
  "network_rules_applied": ["RULE-001", "RULE-002", "RULE-003"],
  "duration_applied": 120  // minutes
}
```

---

### **7. CONTINUOUS LOOP: Real-Time Monitoring**
**What happens:** The system doesn't stop - it continuously monitors for new threats and adapts.

**Feedback Loop:**

1. **Enforcement actions are monitored** - Did blocking the IP stop the attack?
2. **New telemetry is collected** - What's happening now?
3. **Models adapt** - If the attacker changes tactics, models retrain
4. **Policies update** - Risk scores adjust based on behavior

**Adaptive Learning:**

- **Every 100 new labeled samples** → Model retrains
- **User feedback** (false positives/negatives) → Immediate learning
- **Drift detection** - If accuracy drops below 85%, trigger retraining

**Example Adaptation:**
```
Time 0:00 - Attacker uses known SQLi pattern → Detected (confidence: 0.95)
Time 0:15 - Attacker modifies payload slightly → Detected (confidence: 0.78)
Time 0:30 - Attacker uses new evasion → Missed (confidence: 0.45)
Time 0:35 - Security team labels as threat → Model retrains
Time 0:45 - Same evasion attempted → Detected (confidence: 0.91)
```

---

### **8. END: Logging and Retraining**
**What happens:** All events are logged, and the system learns from experience.

#### **Logging System:**

Currently logs to **JSON files** in `logs/` directory:
```
logs/
├── detections.log     - All threat detections
├── policy.log         - Policy decisions
├── enforcement.log    - Enforcement actions
└── performance.log    - System metrics
```

**Future Enhancement (Elasticsearch):**
Your system is designed to integrate with Elasticsearch for:
- Centralized logging across distributed deployments
- Full-text search of security events
- Real-time dashboards (Kibana)
- Long-term historical analysis

#### **Retraining Triggers:**

**Automatic retraining when:**
1. **Drift detected** - Model accuracy drops (statistical tests)
2. **New attack patterns** - 100+ new labeled samples collected
3. **Scheduled** - Weekly full retraining on all historical data
4. **Manual** - Security team triggers after major incident

**Retraining Process:**
```python
# From ml_threat_detector.py:596
def retrain_model(self):
    # 1. Collect all samples (threat_buffer + feedback_buffer)
    # 2. Re-fit preprocessing pipeline
    # 3. Split data (80% train, 20% validation)
    # 4. Train new model with updated data
    # 5. Validate performance > threshold
    # 6. Hot-swap old model → new model
    # 7. Save checkpoint
```

**Model Versioning:**
- Models saved with timestamps: `cnn_detector_2025-01-15.pt`
- Performance metrics tracked: accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- Rollback capability if new model performs worse

## Real-World Example: Detecting a SQL Injection Attack

Let's walk through how your system detects and responds to an actual attack:

### **Attack Scenario:**
An attacker sends: `https://yoursite.com/login?user=admin'--`

### **Step-by-Step Processing:**

**1. Telemetry Collection (< 1ms)**
```
NetworkTelemetryAgent captures:
- src_ip: 203.0.113.45
- dst_ip: 192.168.1.10
- protocol: HTTP
- port: 80
- payload: "user=admin'--"
- packet_size: 147 bytes
```

**2. Preprocessing (5-10ms)**
```
DataCleaner: No duplicates, no missing data ✓
FeatureEngineer creates:
- payload_entropy: 3.2 (suspicious)
- sql_keyword_count: 2 ('admin', '--')
- special_char_density: 0.13 (high)
- port_is_web: 1.0
DataNormalizer: Scales to [-1.5, 2.3, 0.8, ...]
```

**3. ML Analysis (10-15ms)**
```
CNN Detector:     SQLi confidence: 0.94
Autoencoder:      Anomaly score: 0.87
LSTM-Transformer: Sequential pattern: 0.76
MLP Classifier:   SQLi confidence: 0.89

Ensemble Decision:
- is_threat: TRUE
- threat_type: sql_injection
- confidence: 0.89
- MITRE: Initial Access (T1190)
```

**4. Policy Decision (2ms)**
```
UEBA Check:
- IP 203.0.113.45: Unknown (new source)
- No baseline behavior
- Risk score: 0.91

Policy Engine Decision:
- action: DENY + QUARANTINE
- risk_level: CRITICAL
- reasoning: "SQL injection detected from unknown source"
- duration: 24 hours
```

**5. Enforcement (5ms)**
```
SDN Controller executes:
1. BLOCK_IP: 203.0.113.45 → all traffic dropped
2. TCP RST: Terminate existing connection
3. Firewall rule: Priority 1000, expires in 24h
4. Alert: Email to security@yourcompany.com

Result: Attack blocked in 25ms total
```

**6. Logging**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:23:17.892Z",
  "event_type": "threat_blocked",
  "threat_type": "sql_injection",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "source_ip": "203.0.113.45",
  "action_taken": "blocked_and_quarantined",
  "response_time_ms": 25
}
```
