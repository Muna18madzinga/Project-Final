## üìä Example Usage

### Detecting AI-Generated Phishing
```python
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/threat/detect-ai-social-engineering', 
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'},
    json={
        'content': 'As an AI language model, I must inform you that your account needs urgent verification',
        'audio_metadata': {'quality': 'poor', 'background_noise': 'consistent'}
    }
)

result = response.json()
if result['is_ai_social_engineering']:
    print(f"AI social engineering detected with {result['confidence']:.2%} confidence")
    print(f"Indicators: {result['indicators']}")
```

### Detecting Adversarial ML Attacks
```python
# Protecting your ML model from adversarial inputs
ml_input = [0.1, 0.5, 0.8, ...]  # Your model's input features

response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/threat/detect-adversarial-ml',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'},
    json={
        'ml_input': ml_input,
        'metadata': 'user_submitted_data'
    }
)

result = response.json()
if result['is_adversarial']:
    print(f"Adversarial attack detected: {result['adversarial_attacks']}")
    # Block the input or apply defensive measures
```

### Adding Custom Threat Intelligence
```python
# Add new threat intelligence as threats evolve
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/threat/add-threat-intelligence',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {admin_token}'},
    json={
        'threat_id': 'CUSTOM-2025-001',
        'threat_type': 'ai_social_engineering',

        'source': 'threat_research_team',
        'metadata': {'campaign': 'operation_ai_deceive'}
    }
)
```

## üîÑ Self-Adaptation in Action

The system continuously adapts based on:

1. **False Positive Feedback**: Automatically lowers thresholds if too many false positives
2. **New Threat Patterns**: Learns from newly identified threats
3. **Performance Metrics**: Adjusts based on detection accuracy
4. **Threat Evolution**: Tracks how existing threats modify their patterns

### Adaptation Example
```
Initial AI Social Engineering Threshold: 0.7
After 100 detections with 25% false positives:
Adapted Threshold: 0.75 (increased to reduce false positives)

New AI attack pattern detected:
System automatically adds pattern to detection rules
Threshold adjusted to 0.72 for new pattern type
```
